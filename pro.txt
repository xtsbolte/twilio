Create a high-quality, original 2D illustration inspired by the emotional tone, atmosphere, and visual language of the provided reference image— matching the feeling, not the scene, but similar theme and emotion. The image should feel like it exists in the same emotional universe, as if it were another moment from the same memory, while remaining fully original in characters, layout, and details. Art Style (Strict – Retro, Premium) Hand-drawn 2D illustration with a vintage / analog feel Inspired by 80s–90s animation or illustration Loose, imperfect linework (human, slightly uneven) Muted, dusty color palette (soft browns, olives, faded blues, sepia tones) Flat or gently uneven shading with soft washes Visible texture: paper grain, film noise, aged surface Slight asymmetry, organic imperfections No modern, glossy, hyper-clean, anime, or poster-style rendering Composition Rules Minimal background used only for mood Text Overlay (Required, Subtle) Tone: quiet truth, reflective, inevitable New sentence only (reference text but similar same context, same theme, but interesting that matches with image.) Text style: Simple, hand-lettered or basic serif/sans-serif Looks printed or casually written, not designed Placement: Upper portion of the image Centered or gently aligned Calm presence, not dominant Bottom Safety Zone Bottom 20–25% of the image must contain no readable text Only texture, shadow, gradient, fabric, or empty space Originality & Safety Fully fictional characters No recognizable faces or identities Final Quality Goal The final image should feel premium, eye-catching, and emotionally quiet— something that makes people stop scrolling, not because it’s loud, but because it feels real.
